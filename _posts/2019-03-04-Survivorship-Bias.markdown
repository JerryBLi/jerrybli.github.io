Survivorship Bias is an interesting selection bias that can lead to false conclusions and impact our decisions. This is similar to the fallacy of "Correlation proves Causation." Suvivorship bias is an incorrect attribution given for success in a group. The idea behind survivorship bias is incorrectly extrapolating the success from a group of "survivors" or successful members from a larger group without taking into account those who are not successful. Suvivorship bias teaches us to examine the data that we have and ask ourselves "what do we not have?"

The original example of suvivorship bias was for military bombers in World War II. The military wanted to know which locations on the aircraft to add additional armor on their bombers to increase the chance of survival. One study examined aircraft returning back from a mission and accounted for the locations on the aircraft where there was the most damage. The study \(wrongly\) concluded that the aircraft should be reinforced at the locations where they took the most damage. A statistician, Abraham Wald, concluded that armor should, instead, be added to the locations where there was the least amount of damage. He argued that the places where there was damage represented places where the aircraft could take damage and still return home. Wald also argued that if the aircraft was hit in the locations that were unscathed, the plane would not survive. All the surviving planes displayed the same locations of having no damage because those that were hit in those locations were lost.

Survivorship bias should be taken into account when we see stories of success. There are a lot of posts with titles like "X number of things all successful people do" and "The Y attributes of all successful companies" but very few with titles such as "These are Z companies that failed, here's why." We like to read about success, but by doing so, we tend to ignore the broader dataset. We learn about how a few select people become successful but we ignore all the others that have failed. Because of that, we form a conclusion on what to do to become successful rather than what not to do to avoid failure. 

To avoid the survivorship bias, we must be aware of the potential biases of our dataset. Ask ourselves "What data do we not have? What have we missed?" Before coming to a conclusion, be sure all the relevant data is collected, from the successes to the failures.
