## Ingredients
### Oven Roasted Chicken
* 2 Chicken Leg quarters with skin
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* Salt
* Pepper
* Vegetable oil

### Sauce
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1&frasl;8 cup capers
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 twig fresh rosemary
* 3 cloves garlic, finely minced 

### Pan Seared Potatoes
* Whole white round potatoes
* Chicken broth, enough to cover potatoes
* 1 Twig fresh rosemary
* Salt
* Pepper
* Vegetable oil

## Directions
### Oven Roasted Chicken
1. Lift the skin from the flesh of the chicken so that there is a pocket between the skin and the flesh. Thinly slice the unsalted butter and place a tablespoon of butter in the pocket of each chicken 
2. Generously salt the skin-side of the chicken.
3. Turn over the chicken and generously salt and pepper the underside. 
4. Lay the chicken skin-side up on a tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight to pull moisture from the chicken.
5. Pre-heat the oven to 500&deg;F.
6. In a cast iron pan, coat the bottom of the pan with vegetable oil and heat on high until the oil starts to smoke.
7. Lay the chicken skin-side down on the pan.
8. Cook the chicken until the bottom begins to turn golden-brown.
9. Transfer the chicken to the oven to finish cooking until 155&deg;F, the heat will continue to cook the chicken so you don't have to wait until 165&deg;F. This will take about 15-20 minutes.
10. Take the chicken out and flip the chicken over so that the skin-side is up. 
11. Let the chicken rest a few minutes before moving to a plate. Do not dump the drippings from the pan. They will be used for the sauce.

### Sauce
1. After removing the chicken from the pan, heat the drippings on medium-high heat.
2. Add the garlic, onions, and rosemary to the drippings and cook until the onions are soft.
3. Add the butter and capers to the mixture and cook for a minute or two longer.
4. Remove from heat and server over the chicken and potatoes.

### Pan Seared Potatoes
1. In a large pot, add the chicken broth, rosemary, and a generous amount of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil.
2. Add the potatoes to the pot. Make sure there is only one layer of potatoes. 
3. Cook the potatoes until they're soft all the way through, about 20 minutes.
4. Heat a pan with vegetable oil on medium-high heat.
5. Take the potatoes out of the pot and cut each one in half.
6. Lay the potatoes, cut side down in the pan.
7. Add salt and pepper to the potatoes.
8. After the bottom of the potatoes turn a rich golden-brown, flip the potatoes over. 
9. Remove the potatoes from the pan when both sides are golden-brown.
