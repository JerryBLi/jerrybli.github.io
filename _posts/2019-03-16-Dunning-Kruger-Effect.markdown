The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people who are incompetent at a task mistakenly rate themselves better at the task than they really are. This is named after the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger for their 1999 study. In a separate study, researchers asked software engineers at two companies to rate their skills. In one company, 32% of software engineers rated themselves in being in the top 5% of software engineers in their company, while in the other company, 42% rated themselves in being in the top 5%. A lot of engineers overestimated their abilities - only 5% of engineers can be the top 5%.

This is especially prevalent in beginner and intermediate levels where people tend to overestimate the amount they know. It results in people making mistakes and less than desirable outcomes. While it's not always the case, those with more experience and in more senior roles tend to know how knowledgeable they are and thus can judge their abilities better. This lack of knowledge from those people less experienced further prevents them from catching their mistakes and fixing them in the future. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a commentary on those with big egos - it's a commentary on how those lacking skills fail to realize where they err. Most people, once properly trained, will be able to recognize the mistakes and the gaps in knowledge from prior work.

The Dunning-Kruger effect has a nasty dual effect where people not only overrate their abilities causing mistakes in their work but also simultaneously are blinded from the errors from the lack of knowledge. So how can one recognize their abilities? Take all constructive criticism and take them from a lot of varying sources. Sometimes feedback can be harsh, but being able to recognize where you can improve will expand your knowledge.
