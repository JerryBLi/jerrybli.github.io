In the [Oven Roasted Chicken](https://www.boruli.com/Oven-Roasted-Chicken/) recipe, the chicken was delicious but I mentioned that the meal was very rich. I wanted to make the chicken again but instead of eating it alone as the main dish, I wanted something that would balance the chicken. I decided that I would cut the fatty richness from the chicken by mixing it in a salad. In this recipe, I mixed the rich and savory chicken with vibrant fresh vegetables, all balanced together with a tangy blueberry vinaigrette.

## Ingredients
### Salad
* 2 eggs, soft boiled
* 1 large carrot, julienned
* 2 small radishes, sliced thinly
* Spring salad mix, enough for two servings
### Chicken
* 2 chicken thighs, with skin on
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 twig of fresh rosemary
* 3 whole cloves garlic
* Salt
* Pepper
* Vegetable oil

### Blueberry Vinaigrette
* 1&frasl;2 cup fresh blueberries
* 1&frasl;4 cup balsamic vinegar
* 1&frasl;4 cup high-quality olive oil*
* 1 tablespoon honey
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions
### Chicken
Follow the steps to make the chicken in the [Oven Roasted Chicken](https://www.boruli.com/Oven-Roasted-Chicken/) recipe and simply add the garlic and rosemary into the pan right before you put it into the oven. I did this because we're no longer making a sauce so the flavors will be imparted to the chicken while baking. Let the chicken sit for 10 minutes before cutting and adding to the salad.

### Blueberry Vinaigrette
1. Mix the blueberries, balsamic vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper in a blender.
2. Blend the mixture until smooth
3. While still blending, slowly add the olive oil to the mixture to make an emulsion.
4. Let sit at room temperature for a few minutes.

### Salad
1. Toss the salad with the blueberry vinaigrette, leave some of the vinaigrette aside to drizzle on top of the salad.
2. Divide salad into two plates.
3. Top the two salads with the radishes, carrots, and soft-boiled eggs
4. Place a whole, soft-boiled egg on each salad.
5. Remove any bones in the chicken and cut the chicken into thin slices.
6. Top the salad with the chicken and any remaining vinaigrette.
