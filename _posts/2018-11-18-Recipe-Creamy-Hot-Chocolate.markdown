Traditionally there's a difference between hot chocolate and hot cocoa. Hot cocoa is the mixture of cocoa powder, sugar, and milk. It's light, watery, and sweet. Unlike hot cocoa, hot chocolate is usually thick and creamy. Hot chocolate is traditionally shaved chocolate melted in milk and can be made with any type of chocolate. For this recipe, I'm mixing both concepts to create a creamier hot cocoa that's decadent but isn't overbearingly thick. The melted chocolate gives the creaminess, the butter gives a full-flavor, and the sugar/cocoa mix gives that extra bit of sweetness.


## Ingredients

* 1&frasl;8 cup cocoa powder
* 1&frasl;4 cup white sugar
* 1&frasl;4 teaspoon salt
* 1&frasl;4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 1&frasl;2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1&frasl;2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1&frasl;2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
* Whipped Cream

## Directions
1. Mix the cocoa powder, white sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl.
2. Heat the unsweetened almond milk in a sauce pan on the stove until hot, but not boiling.
3. While the almond milk is heating up, in a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips and unsalted butter.
4. When the chocolate chips and butter are melted and creamy, pour into a mug.
5. Scoop 1&frasl;8 cup of the dry chocolate and sugar mixture into the mug and mix thoroughly until smooth
6. Add the vanilla extract to the chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly.
7. Add the hot almond milk to the chocolate mixture and mix until the chocolate is dissolved in the milk.
8. Top with whipped cream, and a dusting of cinnamon powder.
