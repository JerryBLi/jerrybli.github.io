This is a deliciously creamy pasta recipe that is so simple yet so elegant. Traditionally, in Italy, the meat used is guanciale which is cured meat from pork jowls. I haven't been able to find guanciale in the United States so this recipe used pancetta as a substitute. Pancetta is pretty much bacon with more pepper and without the smoke - if you can't find pancetta, thick sliced bacon also works. 

## Ingredients
* 2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk
* 8 oz of dried pasta
* 1&frasl;2 cup dry white wine (I use chardonnay)
* 3 oz pancetta (about 3 thick slices)
* 3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
* 1&frasl;2 cup pasta water 
* Freshly grated pepper

## Directions
1. In a large pot, bring salted water to boil, and cook the pasta according to instructions. I usually take the pasta out and strain it one minute before the recommended time so that it can cook while in the pan. Be sure to generously salt the water but don't over salt it since we're using the pasta water in the recipe itself. Also remember when the pasta is about to be done, be sure to reserve 1&frasl;2 cup of the pasta water.
2. In a stainless-steel pan, fry the pancetta on medium heat until golden-brown. Use a stainless-steel pan because of the Fond that develops on the bottom of the pan as the pancetta cooks.
3. De-glaze the pan with the white wine and let the mixture reduce.
4. Take the pan off the heat.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and egg yolk until smooth. Add  1&frasl;4 cup of the pasta water into the egg mixture and beat well. This will bring the temperature of the mixture up a bit.
6. Add the egg mixture to the cooled pan with the pancetta. Mix together.
7. Put the pan on the burner on low heat. The moment you put on the pan, dump the strained pasta into the pan and begin mixing. Add the Pecorino Romano and pepper but do not stop mixing. Add the remaining pasta water. **This is a crucial moment: continue mixing until the egg begins to turn creamy. Once that happens, immediately take off the heat and serve.**
