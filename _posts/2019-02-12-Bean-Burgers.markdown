These bean burgers are a great substitute for meat burgers. They pair wonderfully with some guacamole and pico de gallo.  

## Ingredients
* 8oz button mushrooms
* 1 medium onion
* 3 cloves garlic, finely minced
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 cup sweetcorn
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 2 15.5oz cans black beans
* Salt and Pepper to taste

## Directions
1. Finely chop the mushrooms and onion.
2. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan. Add the garlic and onions to the pan and cook until the onions no longer release water. Add the mushrooms to the pan. Cook until the mushrooms no longer release water. Add salt and pepper to the mixture. Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool.
3. Drain the cans of black beans and add the beans to a large bowl. Using a potato masher, mash the black beans.
4. Mix together the mushroom mixture, egg, corn, bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to the mashed black beans.
5. Divide the mixture into 8 large patties.
