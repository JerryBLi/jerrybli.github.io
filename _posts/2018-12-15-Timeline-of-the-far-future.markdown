Wikipedia isn't just a place with a lot of information; it's a place with a lot of *cool* information. Wikipedia has an article titled ["Timelime of the far future"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future) that describes the scientific predictions of the world and universe way into the distant future \(mind-bogglingly large number of years into the future\). Here's some events I found really interesting:
* **10<sup>6</sup> years from now** - The minimum time for humanity to become a Type III civilization according to the Kardashev scale.
* **7.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> years from now** - Mount Rushmore would erode to a point where we won't be able to recognize it.
* **5.4 x 10<sup>9</sup> years from now** - The Sun begins to evolve into a red giant star because it has used its hydrogen.
* **10<sup>12</sup> years from now** - If the curvature of the universe is positive, this is the estimated time the universe would end in the Big Crunch (all the matter of the universe will collapse into a singularity). The current observations of the universe do not support this model.
* **10<sup>14</sup> years from now** - All the free floating hydrogen in the universe would have been used up and no more stars would form.
* **1.7 x 10<sup>106</sup> years from now** - Time for a super massive black hole to dissipate from Hawking radiation. The universe will be practically empty.

This article is certainly different than most Wikipedia articles. Besides the few events I listed, there's a lot of other events that are also very interesting in the article. I highly recommend taking a few minutes and reading about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future).
