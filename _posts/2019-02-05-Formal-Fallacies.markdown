I remember first learning about this in high school geometry but it's not until recently I realized its day-to-day importance.

Imagine I said the following:

```
If I'm a good programmer, I write a lot of code.
``` 

and I follow it up with saying:

```
I write a lot of code.
```

A lot of people would automatically infer that I am a good programmer. This inference is a formal fallacy called the "fallacy of the converse", also known as "affirming the consequent." Just because I said I write a lot of code doesn't mean I'm a good programmer. I could write a lot of bad spaghetti code \(I don't\) which would mean I'm not a good programmer. If you don't quite get it, here's another example:
```
If it rained, then the grass gets wet.
The grass is wet.
Therefore, it rained
```
The inference that it rained because the grass is wet is wrong! Just because it is wet does not mean in rained, I could have watered the grass with a hose.

The fallacy of the converse wrongly infers the converse given a true conditional statement. It takes the form of:
```
If P, then Q
Given Q 
Therefore P
```

Something similar is the "fallacy of the inverse", also known as "denying the antecedent." This is the formal fallacy where the inverse is inferred from the original statement. This takes the form of:
```
If P, then Q
Therefore, if not P, then not Q
```

An example with my previous good programmer example is if I said:
```
If I'm a good programmer, I write a lot of code.
I'm not a good programmer.
``` 
We'd be falling for the fallacy of the inverse if we came to the conclusion that I didn't write a lot of code. As we've established earlier, I could be a bad programmer and write a lot of code.

Only recently have I realized the importance of these fallacies. We should always be concious of them when we communicate with others. They're easily missed and making the wrong inference in a task or project usually ends up costing extra time and money. We should always be concious of how we convey our messages to others and make sure that it's simple and uncomplicated and while we're listening, we shouldn't immediately jump to conclusions; we should think about the problem thoroughly.
