## Overview
Over this summer I became interested in woodworking - specifically, building a table from scratch. 
I remember watching a video of someone building a butcher block style table top and I was absolutely blown away by how beautiful the end result was. I decided that I wanted to dig out my safety glasses from somewhere in the basement and try my hand at building a table. I needed a new desk and I might as well build my own this time around. I convinced myself that it'll be cheaper to build a table than to buy an equivalent one online \(it was not\) and not to mention that my table would be made of solid wood instead of the particle board of many cheap desks out there. Before making a single cut, I watched many videos and read many blog posts on how to proceed. Looking back, I had an amazing time building this but it would have definitely been cheaper and easier to buy something online.

## Materials, Tools, and Design
I decided to go simple on the table since it was my first project. I would create the table top out of wood and then buy metal table legs and use those instead of creating anything fancy such as drawers or cabinets. I wanted to combine metal and wood together for a contemporary feel. I initially wanted to use U-shaped metal as my legs; I found some amazing ones online but they were quite pricey for a first-time project and they were unfinished steel, meaning I had to paint them myself which I wanted to avoid. I ended up settling for a pack of four metal desk legs from Amazon. 

For the table top, I wanted to recreate the butcher block look with multiple species of wood. The striations of different wood looked gorgeous from the video I watched. I went to my local home improvement store and found out that 

1. Hardwoods are expensive and 
2. There aren't many choices for hardwoods at my local store

I settled on using 2 x 6 pine planks instead and gluing them by their edges to create my table top. This made the materials quite cheap - 2 x 6 planks aren't expensive compared to hardwood planks.

For my power tools, I used a table saw, a circular saw, a hand planer, and an orbital sander along with other miscellaneous tools such as a tape measure, level, and clamps.

## Putting in the work
The first thing I saw everywhere was that I needed to joint the plank, or make the edges of the wood completely straight. As straight as the lumber looks from the store, there's some curve that I needed to straighten. Videos made the task seem easy with a table saw but I learned quite quickly that it was not easy. The theory is straight forward \(sorry for the pun\) but in practice, I was not successful. Suffice to say, I think the planks were straighter before I cut them. 

I ended up getting the edges close enough and just glued all the planks together with wood glue and clamped them for a day. I'm sure a professional would have a heart attack seeing the huge gaps from the unstraight wood. But hey, now I have the base for my table top. I used a hand-held planer and many passes to make the whole top and bottom of the table flat. A flat table is quite necessary if I want to use it to do actual work - it's not practical to do anything if there's bumps everywhere. I ended with sanding the table with 80 grit, 120 grit, and 220 grit sand paper to ensure a smooth finish to my table. Now, I can stain the table to give the table some life and not the dull pine color of the wood.

I found out that pine, and other soft woods, do not take stain nicely on its own. The pine absorbs the stain at different amounts so it results in blotchy areas if the pine is not treated with a pre-stain first. So before I can stain, I had to apply pre-stain to allow for even penetration of the stain. For the color, I decided I wanted to use red-mahogany - it gave a deep dark wood color that looks absolutely beautiful. 

After staining, a protective finish must be added. I read there's many different options including tung oil, lacquer, and polyurethane. I decided on using polyurethane - I read that it's common and easy. I applied multiple coats according to the instructions and the glossy coat gave the table top a stunning vibrant look.

Finally, the last step was simply adding the table legs to the finished table top and ta-da! Done.

## Final Thoughts

Building this table was a multi-day ordeal and an interesting learning experience. It ended up being quite expensive buying all the necessary materials but the end result was extremely satisfying. It would have been far simpler and even cheaper to buy a table online but now I know how to build a table. I think that I'll continue woodworking in the future.
