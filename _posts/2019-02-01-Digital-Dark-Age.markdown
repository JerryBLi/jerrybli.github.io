I encountered this concept of the Digital Dark Age a few years back and I found it quite unsettling. If you were a modern-day historian, how would you learn about the humans of the past? One of the most insightful methods is to read the text that they left behind. We've gleaned insightful knowledge about the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Greeks, Romans, and so many more civilizations from the writings that still exist. Now, imagine in the future 1000 years from now, historians want to know about the early 21st century. What information would they have? What would we have left behind? Hard drives, USB sticks, computers? 

So much of our information is stored in a digital format. As with all digital formats, they have an encoding, or a specific way the information is stored, and each encoding is different. This is an issue because formats can become outdated or the hardware to read the data will become slowly stop working. Think about the last time you saw a floppy drive \(if you've ever seen one\). Now imagine hundreds of years into the future - the chances of the future generations would have access to methods to read the data will slowly diminish until they will no longer have access to the data. This is where the term "dark age" comes in. Despite living in such a data-driven world, those in the future may have little access to our data.

Something related to this is the manufacture of paper. The modern day paper manufacture process produces paper that deteriorates significantly faster than paper from the past. This is part due to the materials used today as well as the chemicals used. This combined with the inaccessibility of our digital data in the future leads to a future where historians would not have many records of our present day

There's a few efforts to mitigate this issue. These include backing up digital copies of data to magnetic tape as well as standardizing the digital storage format. There's also an effort to utilize formats that are an open standard, that is that the standard of storing the data is openly available to anyone. While these efforts will preserve some data, it is certain that a lot of our digital data will be lost forever in the future.
