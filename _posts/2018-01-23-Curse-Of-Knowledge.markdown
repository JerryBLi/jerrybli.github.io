I recently stumbled upon the phenomenon known as "Curse of Knowledge." It describes a communication disconnect between a person trying to communicate an idea and a person trying to understand the idea. 
The disconnect happens because the communicator subconsciously assumes that the person they're communicating to has background knowledge about certain things that, in reality, they do not have. This 
was demonstrated in a 1990 paper by Elizabet Newton with a tapping experiment. In the experiment, there was one person who had to tap out the melody to a song while another tried to guess the song from the taps.
When the tappers were asked to guess how often the listeners would predict the song correctly, the tappers would grossly overestimate from the actual percentage. 
Ths curse of knowledge was demonstrated because those who tapped were familiar with the song (they had the melody in their head while tapping) and they assumed the listener would be able to decipher the song while
in reality, the listener only hears a series of taps with no other information.

Everyday, this comes up in many places - professors who are incredibly talented and smart but have a difficult time teaching students so that they understand the material or business people who don't clearly explain a company initiative and the underlings
have no concrete idea of which direction to implement the new initiative. The curse of knowledge even comes up when playing charades - for the person miming, the word is known and obvious but for those guessing, there's a significant disconnect between the word and how it's being communicated. 
This often leads to frustration on both sides, the guessers feel the person miming is miming badly while the one miming wonders how those guessing couldn't think of such an obvious word! This happens in tech as well. 
We get comfortable describing products and projects using acronyms with those who we work with daily that when we're talking to someone new, someone who isn't familiar with the acronyms that is used, we tend to overwhelm them! 
This is obviously not good; good communication makes for more [productive teams](https://www.holmesreport.com/latest/article/the-cost-of-poor-communications). 

Now that we're aware of such an issue, we should combat it so that we don't accidentally fall victim to the curse of knowledge. What can we do? 
* **Always be conscious that the curse of knowledge exists when talking to someone else** - Knowing such a thing exists is the first step to combat it.
* **Translate with concrete examples** - After you explain something, give an example of what you mean; this clears up any ambiguous meaning by painting a picture of what you're trying to explain.
* **Bring in a beginner** - if the beginner can understand what you're trying to explain, then there is no communication disconnect since you've effectively reached the audience.
* **Practice the Feynman Technique** - A step in the Feynman Technique is to be able to explain things in a simple manner. If you master the Feynman Technique, you're less likely to fall victim to the curse of knowledge
* **Pretend you're a first time user** - Think back to the first time you encountered whatever you're trying to explain; if you could explain it to yourself, what would you say?

Most of the techniques center around explaining everything as if the listener is a beginner. Make no assumptions about the listener's previous knowledge and explaining everything in a simple manner, this could prevent much headache further down the road.
