Hey there! My name is Jerry and I am currently a Software Engineer at TripAdvisor working on the Hotels team. I love learning new things and improving old ones. While I'm not writing code or tinkering with electronics, I like to cook and work out. 

I strive to write clean and efficient code. As of now, I'm primarily working with Java and React. I've developed software solutions in many languages including:
* Java
* C
* C++
* C#
* LabVIEW
* and others
